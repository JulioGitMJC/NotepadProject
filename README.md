How to run:
1) Extract the folder, then open with VS code.
2) Open a new terminal (MAKE SURE YOU'RE USING CMD NOT POWERSHELL) and run the command npm install. This should install a new folder called nodes_modules.
3) Navigate to the project folder and run the command node src/server.js (MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE MAIN PROJECT FOLDER, NOT SRC FOLDER).
3) Open a second cmd terminal and use command npm start.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

running server

1.open ec2

2. Install Node.js, npm, git, and serve

curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo bash -
sudo yum install -y nodejs git
sudo npm install -g serve

3 Clone your GitHub repo and switch to the Test branch
git clone https://github.com/JulioGitMJC/NotepadProject.git of fro certain branches put git clone --branch {branch name} and blah balha blah
cd NotepadProject


4. Install dependencies and build React, in the root folder, so just open the main notepad folder wih cd

npm install
npm run build

5. Run the server with serve on port 80

sudo npx serve -s build -l 80

6. Open your site in the browser:
http://YOUR_PUBLIC_EC2_IP

7. if sever stops make sure port 80 is open and ready to use and run
sudo npx serve -s build -l 80
